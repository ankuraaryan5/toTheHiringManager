Interpreter translates one statement at a time into machine code
Whereas Compiler translates scans the entire program and translates whole of it into machine code


interpreter 
--> one statement at a time
--> it is needed everytime
--> partial execution till error
--> easy for programmers
ex: python, javascript

Compiler
--> entire program at a time
--> once compiled it is needed
--> no execution if error occurs
--> usually not as easy as interpreted 
ex: C, C++

compiled languages are faster


is Java compiled or interpreted language?
--> Java is a hybrid language, both compiled and interpreted as well.

Java File --> javac compiler--> Class File --> byteCode(platform independent) --> can be used by java Interpreter

--> A jvm is used to interpret this byteCode
--> this byteCode can be taken to any platform for execution
--> hence Java is platform independent

Executing a Java Program --> javac One.java(compiled and generates a class file One.class) --> java One (Interpreted)

Package in Java
--> A package is used to group related classes. It help in avoiding name conflicts.
--> There are two types of packages:
i) Built-in Package --> Java API
ii) User Defined Package --> Custom Package

Access Modifiers in Java
--> It determines whether other classes can use a particular feild or invoke a particular method.
--> Can be Public, Private, Protected, or default(no modifier)

Modifier	Class	Package	Subclass	World
public	    Y	    Y	    Y	        Y
protected	Y	    Y	    Y	        N
no modifier	Y	    Y	    N	        N
private	    Y	    N	    N	        N
